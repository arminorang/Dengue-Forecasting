You could build a multimodal, explainable “Structural Dengue Vulnerability Forecaster” that predicts short‑term dengue risk while showing how structural inequality and environment contribute to each prediction at the neighborhood/municipality level. 
Core idea

    Train a multimodal model to predict dengue incidence or outbreak probability 1–3 months ahead at district/municipality level, using: past dengue cases, socioeconomic/inequality indicators, climate, and satellite‑derived urban form.

    Wrap the model in an explainability layer that decomposes each prediction into contributions from structural inequality vs climate vs urban environment, providing global (across Brazil) and local (per district) explanations.

    Data modalities and prediction target

    Target
     
        Monthly dengue cases or a binary “outbreak” label per district/municipality, e.g., as done in GeoSeeq Dengue and Rio‑focused forecasting.

    Modalities
    Structural inequality: census variables (income, overcrowding, sanitation, race, education, access to health services), leveraging Brazilian inequality and health surveys.
    Historical epidemiology: past dengue (and possibly zika/chikungunya) case counts and rates.
    Climate: temperature, rainfall, humidity indices at monthly resolution.

    Satellite imagery: Sentinel‑2 or a prepared dengue imagery dataset to capture urban density, vegetation, standing water proxies, as in DengueNet‑style work.

    Model and XAI design
    Multimodal architecture
        A tabular branch (gradient boosting or MLP) for structural and time‑series features, plus a CNN/ViT encoder for satellite tiles; fuse embeddings before the prediction head.

    Benchmark against a strong tabular model (e.g., CatBoost) like previous explainable dengue forecasters used for Rio de Janeiro.

    Explainability components
    Global feature importance (SHAP/TreeSHAP or permutation importance) to show, on average, how much structural inequality vs climate vs history drives forecasts.
    Local explanations per district and month (SHAP values, ICE plots) to reveal why the model flags a particular vulnerable area.
    For imagery, Grad‑CAM or attention maps over satellite tiles to highlight where in the urban landscape the model “looks” when associating risk (e.g., dense informal settlements vs green zones).

    A simple decomposition: variance explained or performance drop when you ablate entire blocks of features (inequality vs climate vs imagery) to quantify their relative importance.

    How it centers structural inequality
    Make structural features first‑class citizens: explicitly group features into “structural inequality”, “climate”, “vector/environment”, and “history” and plot their grouped contributions for each prediction.
    Use partial‑dependence and SHAP interaction plots to examine how inequality and climate interact: e.g., whether heavy rainfall only becomes high‑risk in areas with poor sanitation and high crowding.

    Tie explanations back to the vulnerability framing of the British Academy project, which argues that dengue risk is produced by socio‑spatial inequalities in Brazil rather than just weather–mosquito dynamics.

    Suggested repo deliverables
    Clean, reproducible pipeline: data download/preprocessing scripts for each modality, model training script, evaluation script, and a small demo notebook that:
        trains a minimal multimodal model on 1–2 states or a single metropolis (e.g., Rio de Janeiro),

    generates maps of predicted risk vs observed cases, and

    renders a few case‑study districts with SHAP bar plots + satellite activation maps that a public‑health reader can interpret.

    If you tell me your preferred framework (PyTorch Lightning vs pure PyTorch vs scikit‑learn + LightGBM) I can sketch a concrete architecture and XAI workflow that’s realistic to implement in a few weeks
